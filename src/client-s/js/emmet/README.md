## Emmet Core = `snippets.min.js`

This was compiled from source using a slightly modified `snippets.json` file that includes `markdown`. The original `snippets.json` file is also include in this directory so it can be used to recompile in the future. In short, `snippets.min.js` contains the Emmet core + snippets, and it excludes the caniuse-db.
